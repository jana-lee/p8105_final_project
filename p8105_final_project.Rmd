## Proposal

**[insert motivation]** talk about climate change and increasing frequency of natural disasters

**[insert final products]** Our team will submit (1) a written report detailing our data collection and analysis, (2) a website and screencast overview of our project and (3) a github repository that holds all this information. These products will highlight the trend of natural disasters across the United States from 1953 to 2018. 

**[insert data sources]**
 
**[insert analyses / visualizations / coding challenges]** Our data consist of natural disaster occurences by type of disaster, state, county, and year among other variables. We'll plan to include graphs of disasters over the years to determine whether natural disasters are increasing as we anticipate. Additionally, we will create a multiple linear regression model with number of natural disasters as the outcome and type of disaster, year, and county as the covariates of interest.
