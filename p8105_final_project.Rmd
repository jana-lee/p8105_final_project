## Proposal

**[insert motivation]** According to the United States Geological Survey, "with global surface temperatures increases the possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for more powerful storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms. Rising sea levels expose higher locations not usually subjected to the power of the sea and to the erosive forces of waves and currents."

**[insert final products]** Our team will submit (1) a written report detailing our data collection and analysis, (2) a website and screencast overview of our project and (3) a github repository that holds all this information. These products will highlight the trend of natural disasters across the United States from 1953 to 2018. 

**[insert data sources]**
 
**[insert analyses / visualizations / coding challenges]** Our data consist of natural disaster occurences by type of disaster, state, county, and year among other variables. We'll plan to include graphs of disasters over the years to determine whether natural disasters are increasing as we anticipate. Additionally, we will create a multiple linear regression model with number of natural disasters as the outcome and type of disaster, year, and county as the covariates of interest. 

**[insert timeline]**

* On Monday, November 11th - Project Review Meeting (can change if anyone is away for the weekend to Tuesday November 12th after Data Science or Epi 3)

* By Friday, November 15th - complete the Motivation, Related work, and Initial Questions sections of the report by this date.

* By Tuesday, November 19th - complete the Data section of the report, which includes any scraping and cleaning. Can move this up if we think it will be easier with our data. Additionally, create the webpage by today. 

* By Tuesday, November 26th - complete the Explotatory analysis phase, this should be the longest section. Format the webpage to include the created plots.

* By Tuesday, November 3rd - complete the Additional analysis and Discussion for the Report. This completes the report. Everything expect the screencast will be on the webpage. Have a spot for the screencast already created.

* On Tuesday, November 3rd -  record screencast, upload to youtube, and put the link on the website. Submit project, repo, website link, and peer assessments.
